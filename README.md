# Resources and providers

The Abiquo cookbook provides the following LWRPs:

## abiquo\_wait\_for\_webapp

This LWRP will make the Chef run wait until the configured webapp is started.

### Parameters

* `host` - The address where the webapp is running
* `port` - The port where the webapp is listening
* `webapp` - The name of the webapp
* `open_timeout` - The timeout to open a connection to the webapp
* `read_timeout` - The timeout to read from a connection to the webapp

### Example

    abiquo_wait_for_webapp "api" do
        host "localhost"
        port 8009
        retries 3   # Retry if Tomcat is still not started
        retry_delay 5
        action :wait
    end

## abiquo\_wait\_for\_port

This LWRP will make the Chef run wait until the configured port is open.

### Parameters

* `host` - The address where the service is running
* `port` - The port where the service is listening
* `service` - The name of the service
* `delay` - The delay in seconds between retries
* `timeout` - The timeout for a connection to be considered failed

### Example

    abiquo_wait_for_port "cassandra" do
        host "localhost"
        port 9160
        delay 10
        timeout 5
        action :wait
    end

# Usage

The cookbook is pretty straightforwatd to use. Just set the `node['abiquo']['profile']` attribute
according to the profile you want to install or upgrade and and include one of the following recipes
in the run list:

* `recipe[abiquo]` - To perform an installation from scratch
* `recipe[abiquo::upgrade]` - To upgrade an existing installation

The available profiles are: `monolithic`, `remoteservices`, `server`, `v2v`, `kvm` and `monitoring`.

When installing the Abiquo Monolithic profile, you may also want to set the `node['abiquo']['certificate']`
properties so the right certificate is used or a self-signed one is generated. You can also use it together
with the [hostname](http://community.opscode.com/cookbooks/hostname) cookbook to make sure the node will have it properly configured.

# Testing

In order to test the cookbook you will need to install [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) and [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/).
Once installed you can run the unit and integration tests as follows:

    bundle install
    bundle exec rake          # Run the unit and style tests
    bundle exec rake kitchen  # Run the integration tests

The tests and Gemfile have been developed using Ruby 2.1.5, and that is the recommended Ruby version to use to run the tests.
Other versions may cause conflicts with the versions of the gems Bundler will install.
